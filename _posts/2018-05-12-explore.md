A block explorer is a critical piece of infrastructure that a BCH developer uses many times a day. They allow you to see the details about blocks, addresses and transactions. Today we're happy to launch [Explore](https://explore.bitbox.earth/)&mdash;a BCH block explorer by BITBOX.

## Explore

Explore features all the stuff you would expect from a block explorer. You can search by [block height](https://explore.bitbox.earth/block/000000000000000000d481c446d213745c0aa789897efd2e4e51d72e842ed9b7), by [legacy](https://explore.bitbox.earth/address/1AyEgvE2XNM65EkdisywrZZghHuMv1ngf8) or [cash address](https://explore.bitbox.earth/address/bitcoincash:qpk4hk3wuxe2uqtqc97n8atzrrr6r5mleczf9sur4h) and [transaction id](https://explore.bitbox.earth/transaction/17c785e23be857459cc7cbf3ff1b2500a7fa68ccdb10918173cddd273478b887). You can also see `OP_RETURN` data which has been encoded per both the BlockPress and Memo protocols.

## Advanced `OP_RETURN` support

Writing data to the blockchain is incredibly powerful. We're witnessing the start of apps leveraging this and w/ `OP_RETURN` increasing from 80 bytes to 220 bytes on May 15th this is just the beginning.

Two of the most exciting apps to emerge which are writing to the blockchain are [BlockPress](https://www.blockpress.com/) and [Memo](https://memo.cash/). Each uses a similar protocol to prefix `OP_RETURN` data to give it semantic meaning around common Web actions such as 'Like', 'Follow' etc.

They allow users to post to the chain and then anyone can write a client which can read the `OP_RETURN`, parse out the prefix and understand the action.

Explore support the full protocol of both BlockPress and Memo.

### BlockPress

BlockPress has a [full protocol](https://www.blockpress.com/developers/blockpress-protocol) and Explore supports 100% of it.

## Highlight vin/vout

You can highlight either a `vin` or `vout` by adding a `input=` and/or `output=` query parameter to the URL.

```js

## Summary

Explore is one more piece in the BITBOX ecosystem which we hope helps accelerate $BCH developers from idea to app.
