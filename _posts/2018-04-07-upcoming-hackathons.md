title:  "Upcoming BITBOX Hackathons"

The goal of BITBOX from day 1 has been to build the go-to toolset for $BCH app developers all over the EARTH. We've made a ton of progress and think it's time to show BITBOX off to the world. With that in mind we're hosting 2 upcoming hackathons where we'll be giving away a total of 4 $BCH to the winning teams.

At each hackathon 1 $BCH will go to the 1st place submission. 0.5 $BCH will go to the 2nd place submission. 0.25 $BCH will go to 2 runner up submissions.
