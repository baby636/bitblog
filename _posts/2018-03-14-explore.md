Each time you start BITBOX it creates a fresh Bitcoin Cash blockchain just for you. This blockchain doesn't connect to the actual $BCH network and only consists of blocks and transactions which you create locally so it's quick and responsive. You can mine new blocks with the click of a button and the coinbase reward will go to the first account in your BITBOX wallet.
